# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- SVG and PNG export options for cron heatmaps via the `--image-format` flag.
- Interactive HTML heatmap generation with per-minute job contribution tooltips.

### Changed

- CLI runs print the absolute paths of every generated artifact (heatmaps, HTML, suggestions) for easier discovery in automation logs.
- The interactive HTML and ASCII heatmaps now summarize both the highest and lowest cron densities, and the HTML footer links to the npm and GitHub project pages.

### Fixed

- Prevented the CLI from generating before/after heatmap images during suggestion runs unless `--image` is explicitly set.
